My first Kaggle-related project.

I decided to use a neural network for the purposes of learning and approaching constraints and limitations in a hands-on way, knowing that tree-based models would yield more accurate results.

What I have come to realize, is:
1. A k-fold validation approach is essential to remove the symptoms of overfitting.
2. My custom LotFrontage imputing approach could have two further considerations:
- Existing LotFrontage scores could be used to measure the accuracy and effectiveness of this, or any imputation strategy.
- The data distribution of LotFrontage could be checked, to see
